First, course which may have their examinations scheduled at the same period are grouped together in all possible ways. ... Scheduling University Course Examinations by Computer A new approach to the problem of scheduling course examinations is presented.

The Merit of Regional Computing Networks One of the suggested means for stimulating the spread of computing capabilities in institutions of higher learning is through the construction of regional computing networks. ... Both the quality and variety of services provided by the central facility were found to play a key role in the effectiveness of the network.

CACM-1608
It is shown that they can be used for some other singularities as well as poles. ... Even if the divergence occurs quite far away, integration formulas like Simpson's, that depend on fitting a polynomial, usually will be inaccurate: near a pole they will be very bad.

Although the vehicle of these investigations has been the game of poker, a conceptual framework has been provided that should have a fairly wide range of applicability. ... There has also been in terest in how humans make deductive and inductive inferences and form and optimize heuristic rules, and how machines can reach similar results.

CACM-3092
Rough estimates of the total systems and programming resources consumed range as high as 75-80 percent in each category. ... It was then submitted to 120 organizations.

CACM-2883
Some experimental results are given; these show how various information about the shape of the contour of an object can be embedded in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy picture and the separation of touching objects. ... Moreover, if heuristic search methods are used, the computing time will depend on the amount of noise in the picture.

Communist China is adjudged to have a marginal computer capability, with most of its machines probably being of a binary nature; however, a turning point may have been reached in mid-1965. ... Computer Technology in Communist China, 1956-1965 Based on information from translations of Communist Chinese news items and periodical literature for the 1965 period, computer technology in China is reviewed under the following headings: (1) initial planning, organization and educational aspects of computer technology and automation; (2) machine development progress: two major specific machines in 1958-59, with Soviet aid; a vacuum in 1960-64 due to the withdrawal of Soviet aid; then presumably all-Chinese-made machines from 1965 to the present; (3) computer applications; (4) the trend of automation: control of production processes rather than data processing; and (5) the "Yun Ch'ou Hsueh" (Science of Operation and Programming) campaign of 1958-60, during which an attempt was made to bring concepts such as linear programming to ordinary Chinese workers and peasants.

In addition, the study demonstrates the usefulness of digital simulations in the examinations of certain aquatic ecosystems, as well as in environmental planning involving such examinations. ... In order to study the relationships between the ecological mechanisms involved, the simulation parameters were varied illustrating the response of the ecosystem to different conditions, including those corresponding to certain types of chemical and thermal pollution.

RRP grammars describe the syntax of programming languages more concisely and more understandably than is possible with CF grammars. ... Formally, RRP grammars have production right parts, which are nondeterministic finite state machines (FSMs), and, as a special case, regular expressions, since these can be converted to FSMs.

This data base includes indexes which facilitate cross referencing of account information so that all relationships between bank and customer may be discerned. ... Generally, this system must interface with other computer applications already existing within the bank.

CACM-3157
Multisets (bags) over a given well-founded set S are sets that admit multiple occurrences of elements taken from S. ... The given ordering on S induces an ordering on the finite multisets over S.

CACM-1194
The indexing system is described in detail. ... The main features of the information system are direct user access via on-line teletypewriter console, direct user access to all details of the system organization, unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, user access through many facets of document indexing, and stochastic search through linked index terms and other file relationships.

CACM-2189
Generation of Rosary Permutations Expressed in Hamiltonian Circuits Systematic generation of a specific class of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is described. ... Each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image each other, and is generated successively by a number system covering 3*4*.

CACM-0796
Transfers between the core and drum stores and to and from the twin paper-tape input and output channels are all available autonomously (concurrently, time-shared). ... Multiplication and division orders are also autonomous, so that the machine may be executing up to three orders simultaneously.

CACM-1890
e. ... This simulation scheme has its excellent point in that it makes it possible to trace the dynamic behavior of traffic flows in a variety of situations, some examples of which are given for an actual area of the city of Kyoto, Japan.

Anomalous Behavior of the Fifty-Percent Rule in Dynamic Memory Allocation This paper reports simulation data showing that, in dynamic memory allocation, the average free-to-allocated-block ratio can differ considerably and in both directions from the predictions of the 50 percent rule. ... The simulations show that allocation efficiency depends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency decreases as the distribution's coefficient of variation increases.

CACM-2033
Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors a given set of messages. ... Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.
