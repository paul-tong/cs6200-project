Responses are generated by reassembly rules associated with selected decomposition rules. ... ELIZA-A Computer Program For the Study ofNatural Language Communication Between Man And Machine ELIZA is a program operating within the MAC time-sharing system at MIT which makes certain kinds of natural language conversation between man and computer possible.

The concept of a register life is in troduced, and used to answer questions like: How many registers are used simultaneously? How many would be sufficient all of the time? Most of the time? What would the overhead be if the number of registers were reduced? What are registers used for during their lives? The paper also discusses the problem of detecting desirable but non-existing instructions. ... Experimental results are presented, obtained by analyzing 41 programs running on the DEC system 10 ISP.

Only those few names most closely resembling the requested name, with their phone numbers annexed, are presented for the agents final manual selecton. ... A program has been developed and operated on the Telefile (a stored-program core and drum memory solid-state computer) which will retrieve passengers' records successfully, despite significant misspellings either at original entry time or at retrieval time.

CACM-2378
A process is able to specify a request for a complicated action on the part of the supervisor (usually a wait on the occurrence of a compound event in the system) by combining these primitives into a "supervisory computer program. ... An Operating System Based on the Concept of a Supervisory Computer An operating system which is organized as a small supervisor and a set of independent processes are described.

CACM-1308
The proposed overall system is presented and experiments and demonstrations are discussed. ... One approach to the mathematical model consists of a group of surface-defining quadric equations, which are created by a system of modular subprogram.

CACM-2957
Relational databases defined as collections of aggregates are structured as a hierarchy on n-ary relations. ... A top-down methodology for database design is described which separates decisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification.

CACM-0533
The need for such a technique often arises in testing the performance of data processing and engineering systems, where inputs corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) are required. ... The method consists of approximating the spectral density by a periodic process with spectral lines, and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random phases and appropriate amplitudes.

An Optimal Method for Deletion in One-Sided Height-Balanced Trees A one-sided height-balanced tree is a binary tree in which every node's right subtree has a height which is equal to or exactly one greater than the height of its left subtree. ... Moreover the method is optimal in the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in order of magnitude.

CACM-2245
, and dynamic predictors. ... It is concluded that a successful CPU scheduling method must be preemptive and must prevent a given job from holding the CPU for too long a period.

CACM-1928
Essential objectives sought are improved ease and economy in model generation, economy in execution time and space, and a facility for handling simultaneous activities. ... Certain aspects of the techniques described may be used for the simulation of network structures other than digital networks.

CACM-2535
Analytical and simulation results are based on the model of the computer-communications system being an M/D/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem with a single exponential server (the computer). ... It is concluded that while, for certain values of system parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the performance of the computer (model), in the sense that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these improvements are offset by the transmission delays imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or no change in the computer-communications system performance.

CACM-2979
Although the vehicle of these investigations has been the game of poker, a conceptual framework has been provided that should have a fairly wide range of applicability. ... There has also been in terest in how humans make deductive and inductive inferences and form and optimize heuristic rules, and how machines can reach similar results.

CACM-2061
The notion of reduction class for a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated. ... In the second part, the utility of the algorithm is discuss ed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design.

CACM-1824
It also has available as normal PL/I variables, the information concerning which of the various alternatives were successful. ... Convenient facilities for multiple input-output streams, the initiation of sequences of parse-requests as a subroutine, and parse-time semantic checks are also included.

CACM-1527
A Grammar Base Question Answering Procedure The subject of this paper is a procedure for the automatic retrieval of certain segments of stored information, either explicitly or implicitly represented, through questions posed in natural language sentences. ... This procedure makes use of a sentence recognition device for the class of grammars which will correctly decide between the grammatical and ungrammatical sentences of a natural language.

CACM-1098
5, and SLIP) A detailed comparison is presented of COMIT, IPL-V, LISP 1. ... Finally, the authors give some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of these languages for use in particular problem applications, concluding that no one of the languages considered is distinctly superior in all possible list-processing applications.

CACM-1725

In particular, functions and labels are permissible results of functions and values of variables. ... e.

CACM-2916
These conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. ... A Fast String Searching Algorithm An algorithm is presented that searches for the location, "i," of the first occurrence of a character string, "pat," in another string, "string.
