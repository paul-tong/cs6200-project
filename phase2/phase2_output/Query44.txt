In this paper, it is shown that, for a consistent system of linear inequalities, any sequence of relaxarion parameters lying strictly between 0 and 2 generates a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution. ... The size and the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, 25,000 inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the coefficients nonzero) makes methods using successive relaxations computationally attractive, as compared to other ways of solving systems of inequalities.

Clarification of Fortran Standards-Second Report In 1966, after four years of effort, Fortran became the first programming language standardized in the United States. ... That work has continued and has resulted in the preparation of this second set of clarifying interpretations.

CACM-1173
This discussion concludes with an assessment of the potential gains of various ways of improving the system. ... The logic of this system is described.

A Class of Iterative Techniques For the Factorization of Polynomials* A method of iteration is developed in terms of a function of somewhat arbitrary character. ... Sufficient conditions are given for convergence of the process, yielding factors of arbitrary degree for polynomials in one variable.

CACM-2129
Recursive Computation of Certain Derivatives-A Study of Error Propagation A brief study is made of the propagation of errors in linear first-order difference equations. ... The recursive computation of successive derivatives of (e^x)/x and (cos x)/x is considered as an illustration.

CACM-3000
They provide new empirical evidence of certain aspects of the construction and behavior of real programs, and some of their implications for the design of virtual memory systems are presented and discussed. ... The results are presented in terms of Johnston's contour model and a simple abstract machine.

CACM-2326
Fix point Approach to the Theory of Computation <B></B> Following the fix point theory of Scott, the semantics of computer programs are defined in terms of the least fix points of recursive programs. ... This allows not only the justification of all existing verification techniques, but also their extension to the handling, in a uniform manner of various properties of computer programs, including correctness, termination, and equivalence.

CACM-2827
The emphasis of this algorithm is on calculating the intersections of quadric surfaces. ... Each value of the parameter represents at most two points, and these may easily be distinguished.

mmp, the Carnegie-Mellon Multi-Mini-Processor. ... HYDRA: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System This paper describes the design philosophy of HYDRA-the kernel of an operating system for C.

CACM-1747
To define the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract machine of a programming language and the notion of a virtual computer are explained. ... Examples of applications of the criteria concern the reading of a time-of-day clock, the synchronization of parallel processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, and the assignment of capability indexes.

It develops a method for evaluating the cost of requiring programmers to work with an abstraction of a real machine. ... Use of the Concept of Transparency in the Design of Hierarchically Structured Systems This paper deals with the design of hierarchically structured programming systems.

CACM-1694
The problem is that of evaluating the sums of the products of all possible combinations of n variables in minimum time and storage space. ... An Algorithm for the Probability of the Union of a Large Number of Events An algorithm is presented which efficiently evaluates the probability for the union of n independent and not mutually exclusive events.

Construction of a Set of Test Matrices This paper develops the equations and properties of a set of test matrices which are useful in the determination of the accuracy of routines for finding the inverse, determinant and/or eigenvalues of a matrix.

CACM-1196
This is true from the point of view of ease of programming, ease of debugging, and minimization of computer time. ... A good general purpose routine for the solution of such systems furnishes a powerful tool for processing many problems.
